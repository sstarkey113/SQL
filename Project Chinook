#In this SQL, I'm querying a database that I downloaded with multiple tables in it to create my own questions that I would like to retrieve from the data. 


1) How many employees are there? Make a table of all employees in alphabetical order, including full name and job title.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.employees;

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title 
FROM chinook.employees
ORDER BY LastName asc;

2) Create a unique/distinct list of countries that our customers are ordering from.

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM chinook.customers;

3) Show only customers in the USA and include what city they are in.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country, City 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'USA'
ORDER BY City;

4)Using the JOIN query, combine the employee table and customer table to show which sales representative helped which customers.
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, employees.LastName AS Sales_Rep
FROM chinook.customers AS customers
JOIN chinook.employees AS employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId

5) Which sales representative made the most sales? 
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, MAX(employees.EmployeeId)
FROM chinook.customers AS customers
JOIN chinook.employees AS employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

6)What is total for all of the invoices.

SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices

7)Write a query to the show the track name that was purchased with the invoice information.
SELECT items.TrackId, items.InvoiceLineId, items.InvoiceId, items.Quantity, items.UnitPrice, items.InvoiceId, tracks.Name 
FROM chinook.invoice_items AS items
JOIN chinook.tracks AS tracks
ON items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
