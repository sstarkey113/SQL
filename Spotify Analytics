# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL, creating questions and then creating queries to solve them.

1) What were the top 5 songs and artisit based off popularity?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 5;

2) On average who was the top artist based off popularity of songs and what was there dancability avg?

SELECT AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), artist_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) desc LIMIT 1;

3)Determine which songs had a duration time of 4 minutes or longer.

SELECT track_name, duration_ms/60000 AS duration_minutes 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_minutes >=4;

4)What was Olivia Rodrigos most popular song and what was the dancability and energy of that track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 1;
